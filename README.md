Thank you Holman, Paul, JFraz, Cowboy... the list goes on and my memory does
not.

A uselessly comprehensive overview of the files live in [the Table of
Contents](./TOC.md).

I'm all about
- 2 or 3 letter aliases
- archiving bash one-liners (so even if I don't remember the function off the
  top of my head, at least I know where I might look before googling again)
- inpenetrable slang, shorthand, personal preferences, opinions, errors,
  gotcha, comments, and all the other things from just using the shit out
  of these fuckers
